Introduction</h2> <p class="svelte-7ke6fz">Welcome to the <strong>Markdown Meta Tag Tester</strong>, a client-side web utility developed by AxelBase ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our tool, which allows users to input Markdown text, validate meta tags, and preview rendered output. We are committed to protecting your privacy and operate on a <strong>privacy-first principle</strong>. Since the tool runs entirely in your browser, <strong>we do not collect, store, or process any personal data</strong>. This policy outlines our practices in detail to ensure transparency and trust.</p> <h2 class="svelte-7ke6fz">2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2> <p class="svelte-7ke6fz">The Markdown Meta Tag Tester is designed to function without gathering any personal information. We do not collect:</p> <ul class="svelte-7ke6fz"><li class="svelte-7ke6fz"><strong>Personal Identifiable Information (PII)</strong>: Such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, or physical addresses.</li> <li class="svelte-7ke6fz"><strong>Usage Data</strong>: Including IP addresses, browser type, device information, or location data.</li> <li class="svelte-7ke6fz"><strong>Content Data</strong>: Any Markdown text you input or upload is processed locally in your browser and is not transmitted to our servers or any third party.</li> <li class="svelte-7ke6fz"><strong>Analytics Data</strong>: We do not use tracking tools like Google Analytics, cookies for session management, or pixels to monitor user behavior.</li></ul> <p class="svelte-7ke6fz">Because all operations occur <strong>client-side</strong>, your data remains on your device. We have no access to it, and there is no server-side storage or logging.</p> <h2 class="svelte-7ke6fz">3. How the Tool Works</h2> <p class="svelte-7ke6fz">When you use the Markdown Meta Tag Tester:</p> <ul class="svelte-7ke6fz"><li class="svelte-7ke6fz"><strong>Input and Processing</strong>: You paste or upload Markdown files directly into the browser interface. The tool uses JavaScript libraries (e.g., <code>marked.js</code> for rendering, <code>js-yaml</code> for parsing) to validate meta tags and generate previews locally.</li> <li class="svelte-7ke6fz"><strong>No Data Transmission</strong>: No data is sent over the internet to us or any external service. Features like export (to HTML) or copy to clipboard happen entirely on your device.</li> <li class="svelte-7ke6fz"><strong>Temporary Local Storage</strong>: The browser may use temporary local storage for session data (e.g., your input text during use), but this is cleared upon reset or page reload. We do not implement persistent storage.</li></ul> <p class="svelte-7ke6fz">This design ensures <strong>complete data isolation</strong>, making the tool suitable for sensitive content.</p> <h2 class="svelte-7ke6fz">4. Third-Party Services</h2> <p class="svelte-7ke6fz">We do not integrate any third-party services that collect data, such as advertising networks or analytics providers. The tool uses open-source libraries hosted locally or via CDNs, but these do not track users. If you choose to export or share outputs, that is done through your browser's native features, and we have no involvement.</p> <h2 class="svelte-7ke6fz">5. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2> <p class="svelte-7ke6fz">The Markdown Meta Tag Tester <strong>does not use cookies</strong>, web beacons, or any tracking technologies. Your session is <strong>stateless</strong>, meaning no information is stored beyond what is necessary for the current use.</p> <h2 class="svelte-7ke6fz">6. Data Security</h2> <p class="svelte-7ke6fz">Although we do not collect data, we encourage users to practice good security habits:</p> <ul class="svelte-7ke6fz"><li class="svelte-7ke6fz">Use secure browsers and devices.</li> <li class="svelte-7ke6fz">Avoid sharing exported files containing sensitive information.</li> <li class="svelte-7ke6fz">Regularly update your software to protect against vulnerabilities.</li></ul> <p class="svelte-7ke6fz">We cannot be responsible for data security on your device, as it is outside our control.</p> <h2 class="svelte-7ke6fz">7. Children's Privacy</h2> <p class="svelte-7ke6fz">Our tool is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has used the tool, please contact us.</p> <h2 class="svelte-7ke6fz">8. International Users</h2> <p class="svelte-7ke6fz">The tool is hosted in a jurisdiction compliant with international privacy standards, but since no data is collected, it adheres to regulations like <strong>GDPR</strong>, <strong>CCPA</strong>, and others by default.</p> <h2 class="svelte-7ke6fz">9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2> <p class="svelte-7ke6fz">We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with the effective date. We encourage you to review it periodically.</p> <h2 class="svelte-7ke6fz">10. Contact Us</h2> <p class="svelte-7ke6fz">If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, contact us at.</p> <p class="italic-note svelte-7ke6fz">This Privacy Policy emphasizes our <strong>no-data-collection commitment</strong>, ensuring users can validate meta tags with peace of mind. By using the tool, you agree to this policy.</p></article></div>`);function I(p){var e=z();v(g=>{var o=w();y.title="Privacy Policy | Markdown Meta Tag Tester";var h=f(m(o),6);t(4),a(()=>l(h,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post7`)),r(g,o)});var s=i(e),u=i(s);t(4),n(s),t(2),n(e),a(()=>l(u,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),r(p,e)}export{I as component,_ as universal};
